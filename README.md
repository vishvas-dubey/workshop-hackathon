# Neo4j Mini Agentic Hack

## Railway Customer Support Demo

RailAssist demonstrates the mini-hack's required memory journey: teach a passenger's trip and support issue, persist connected context, then ask a follow-up and see the agent use the saved PNR, route, issue, assistance need, and railway guidance.

### Run

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Without complete Neo4j credentials, the app runs in local preview mode and persists demo memory in `.railway_demo.sqlite3`. To demonstrate Neo4j, set `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, and `NEO4J_DATABASE` in `.env`. Use a write-enabled database account. The app creates `Passenger`, `Trip`, `Station`, `RailRoute`, `Issue`, `SupportInteraction`, `SupportNeed`, and `Policy` nodes and connects them with relationships such as `HAS_TRIP`, `HAS_ISSUE`, `HAD_INTERACTION`, and `GUIDED_BY`.

For generated answers, optionally set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_MODEL` in `.env`. Without a key, the app uses a local memory-guided response; if the model call fails, it falls back to that response. Use fictional passenger data when sending context to an external model.

### Three-minute demo

1. Keep passenger ID `PAX-1042` and save the sample journey in **Teach the agent**.
2. Show the retrieved trip and issue in **Retrieved memory**; open **Memory graph** to show the connected model.
3. Ask “It's still delayed. What should I do?” The answer should include the saved train, PNR, route, open issue, and any assistance request.
4. Refresh the app and ask again to demonstrate persistence. In Aura mode, the memory is stored in Neo4j; local preview uses SQLite and is clearly labeled.

The prototype does not query live train status, issue refunds, or determine ticket eligibility. Confirm operational information through official railway channels.

## Workshop Content

[Complete the workshop to receive a Neo4j Certificate of Completion](https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/workshop-hackathon).

### Goal

Build and experiment.

Create a small AI application using Neo4j and try one or both of these products:

- [Neo4j Aura Free](https://neo4j.com/product/auradb/) — start building with a free managed Neo4j database
- [Neo4j Document Intelligence](https://neo4j.com/blog/graph-database/introducing-document-intelligence-from-documents-to-a-knowledge-graph-right-inside-aura/) — turn documents into a knowledge graph
- [Neo4j Aura MCP](https://neo4j.com/docs/mcp/current/mcp-for-aura/) — connect AI agents with graph data
- [Neo4j Agent Memory Service](https://memory.neo4jlabs.com/) — give your agents persistent memory

You are free to choose your own idea, documents, stack, and approach.

### Suggested Flow

1. Choose a simple use case.
2. Add documents or data.
3. Build or generate a knowledge graph.
4. Ask connected questions about the graph.
5. Add agent memory if useful.
6. Prepare a short demo.
7. Note what worked, what was confusing, and what blocked you.

A finished production application is not required. A working experiment and useful feedback are enough.

## Hackathon Tools

### GitHub Codespace

[Open the hackathon repository in a GitHub Codespace](https://codespaces.new/neo4j-graphacademy/workshop-hackathon).

### Neo4j Aura MCP

[Neo4j Aura MCP](https://neo4j.com/docs/mcp/current/mcp-for-aura/) is a hosted MCP server for your Aura instance.

1. In the [Aura console](https://console.neo4j.io/), find your instance ID under **Instances**, or select **...** > **Inspect** and copy its MCP server URL.
2. Replace `<instance-id>` in `.vscode/mcp.json` with your Aura instance ID.
3. Start the `neo4j-mcp` server from your editor's MCP server controls.
4. Authorize access when prompted, then open a new coding-agent chat so the tools are detected.

The resulting server URL uses this format:

```text
https://<instance-id>.mcp-instances.neo4j.io
```

### Neo4j GraphAcademy MCP

The GraphAcademy MCP server gives you access to Neo4j learning content.

1. Start the `neo4j-graphacademy` server from your editor's MCP server controls.
2. Authorize access when prompted.


### VS Code MCP Configuration

```json
{
	"servers": {
		"neo4j-mcp": {
			"type": "http",
			"url": "https://<instance-id>.mcp-instances.neo4j.io"
		},
		"neo4j-graphacademy": {
			"type": "http",
			"url": "https://mcp.graphacademy.neo4j.com/mcp"
		}
	},
	"inputs": []
}
```

### Neo4j Skills

Install [Neo4j Skills](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-skills):

```shell
npx skills add https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-skills
```

### Neo4j Aura MCP Starter Prompt

> Use Neo4j Aura MCP to inspect my database schema and suggest three connected questions I can explore.

### Reset the Graph Model

```

### Claude Code?

Install Claude Code on your workspace and ask your instructor for a key.

```
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Then add your MCP servers:

```
claude mcp add --transport http neo4j-graphacademy https://mcp.graphacademy.neo4j.com/mcp
claude mcp add --transport http neo4j-instance https://<instance-id>.mcp-instances.neo4j.io
```

## Need Data for Your Hack?

### Explore Neo4j Example Datasets

Not sure which data to use for your project? Neo4j provides a collection of ready-to-use example datasets that can help you start building and experimenting quickly.

The examples cover a range of graph use cases, including:

- Movies and recommendations
- Retail and product relationships
- Social networks
- Transportation and routing
- Fraud and financial investigations
- Knowledge graphs and connected data

You can use these datasets to explore graph data models, practice writing Cypher queries, test GraphRAG or agentic workflows, and prototype your hack without spending time preparing data from scratch.

Each example includes information about the data model and instructions for accessing or loading the dataset. Depending on the example, you may be able to use it through Neo4j Browser, GitHub, Neo4j Aura, or a public demo server.

Start with the [Neo4j example datasets](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/appendix/example-data/).

You can also explore additional examples and prebuilt projects:

- [Neo4j Sandbox](https://sandbox.neo4j.com/)
- [Neo4j Graph Examples on GitHub](https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples)
- [Neo4j GraphGists](https://neo4j.com/graphgists)

Some datasets and use cases may appear in more than one resource. Choose the format that best fits your workflow, explore the available nodes and relationships, and adapt the example to support your hackathon idea.
