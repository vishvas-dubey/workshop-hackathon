# Neo4j Privilege Reference

Full GRANT / DENY / REVOKE syntax for all privilege types. All commands execute against the **system** database.

---

## General Syntax

```
{GRANT | DENY} [IMMUTABLE] <privilege>
  ON { GRAPH[S] {* | name[,...]} | DATABASE[S] {* | name[,...]} | HOME GRAPH | DBMS }
  [<entity>]
  TO <role>[,...]

REVOKE [IMMUTABLE] [GRANT | DENY] <privilege>
  ON { GRAPH[S] ... | DATABASE[S] ... | DBMS }
  [<entity>]
  FROM <role>[,...]
```

`IMMUTABLE` — privilege cannot be revoked by non-admin users; only `admin` can remove.

---

## Graph Privileges

### Entity scope

| Entity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NODES Label` | Nodes with label (can list: `NODES Person, Company`) |
| `RELATIONSHIPS Type` | Relationships of type |
| `ELEMENTS Label` | Both nodes and relationships |
| `FOR (n:Label) WHERE n.prop = val` | Pattern-matched nodes (read only) |
| *(omit)* | Defaults to `ELEMENTS *` |

### Read privileges

```cypher
GRANT TRAVERSE  ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person TO role;          // can see node, not properties
GRANT READ {*}  ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person TO role;          // read all properties
GRANT READ {name, email} ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person TO role; // read specific properties
GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person TO role;          // TRAVERSE + READ combined
GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH mydb ELEMENTS * TO role;            // all nodes + rels
```

### Write privileges

```cypher
GRANT WRITE     ON GRAPH mydb TO role;              // all writes (shorthand)
GRANT CREATE    ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person TO role; // create Person nodes
GRANT SET PROPERTY {name} ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person TO role;
GRANT MERGE     ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person TO role; // MERGE statement
GRANT DELETE    ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person TO role;
GRANT SET LABEL Person ON GRAPH mydb TO role;
GRANT REMOVE LABEL Person ON GRAPH mydb TO role;
GRANT CREATE    ON GRAPH mydb RELATIONSHIPS KNOWS TO role;
GRANT DELETE    ON GRAPH mydb RELATIONSHIPS KNOWS TO role;
```

### Property-based (sub-graph) read

```cypher
// Pattern in FOR clause must have exactly one property condition
GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH mydb
  FOR (n:Document) WHERE n.visibility = 'public'
  TO reader;

DENY MATCH {*} ON GRAPH mydb
  FOR (n) WHERE n.classification <> 'UNCLASSIFIED'
  TO regularUsers;

GRANT READ { address } ON GRAPH *
  FOR (n:Email|Website) WHERE n.domain = 'example.com'
  TO regularUsers;

// Value present in a LIST property [2026.08]
GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH mydb
  FOR (n:Document) WHERE 'gold' IN n.clearanceLevels
  TO goldTier;

// Property on the right-hand side of the comparison [2026.08]
GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH mydb
  FOR (n:Document) WHERE 1 > n.level
  TO analyst;
```

Supported predicate forms:

| Form | Version | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `n.prop = value`, `<>`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` | all | Scalar comparison, property on the left |
| `value > n.prop` (property on the right) | 2026.08, Cypher 25 | Same comparison, operands reversed |
| `n.prop IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` | all | Property presence |
| `n.prop IN [v1, v2]` / `IN $listParam` | 5.26 | Scalar property matched against a list of values |
| `value IN n.listProp` / `NOT value IN n.listProp` | 2026.08, Cypher 25 | List-valued property contains (or omits) the value |

```cypher
GRANT READ {*} ON GRAPH * FOR (n) WHERE 'EU' IN n.regions TO regularUsers;
GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH * FOR ()-[r]-() WHERE NOT 'EU' IN r.regions TO regularUsers;
GRANT READ {*} ON GRAPH * FOR (n) WHERE 1 > n.level TO regularUsers;
```

`value IN n.listProp` does not match when the property is missing or holds a scalar; the left operand must be a single non-null, non-NaN value.

### Property-based read on Infinigraph [2026.07, not on Aura]

`READ` is the only PBAC privilege supported on sharded property databases; grant it on the virtual database — granting on a shard is rejected.

```cypher
GRANT READ { address } ON GRAPH `foo-sharded`
  FOR (n:Email|Website) WHERE n.domain = 'exampledomain.com'
  TO regularUsers;
```

---

## Database Privileges

```cypher
GRANT ACCESS          ON DATABASE mydb TO role;   // required for any db connection
GRANT START           ON DATABASE mydb TO role;
GRANT STOP            ON DATABASE mydb TO role;
GRANT CREATE INDEX    ON DATABASE mydb TO role;
GRANT DROP INDEX      ON DATABASE mydb TO role;
GRANT SHOW INDEX      ON DATABASE mydb TO role;
GRANT INDEX           ON DATABASE mydb TO role;   // CREATE + DROP + SHOW INDEX
GRANT CREATE CONSTRAINT ON DATABASE mydb TO role;
GRANT DROP CONSTRAINT   ON DATABASE mydb TO role;
GRANT SHOW CONSTRAINT   ON DATABASE mydb TO role;
GRANT CONSTRAINT        ON DATABASE mydb TO role; // CREATE + DROP + SHOW CONSTRAINT
GRANT CREATE NEW ELEMENT TYPES ON DATABASE mydb TO role;  // new labels/types/props
GRANT NAME MANAGEMENT   ON DATABASE mydb TO role; // all element type management
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE mydb TO role;               // all database privileges
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE * TO role;                  // all databases
```

## DBMS Privileges

```cypher
// User management
GRANT SHOW USER     ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT CREATE USER   ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT SET USER STATUS ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT SET PASSWORDS ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT ALTER USER    ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT DROP USER     ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT USER MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO role;   // all user management

// Role management
GRANT SHOW ROLE     ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT CREATE ROLE   ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT RENAME ROLE   ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT DROP ROLE     ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT ASSIGN ROLE   ON DBMS TO role;     // GRANT ROLE ... TO user
GRANT REMOVE ROLE   ON DBMS TO role;     // REVOKE ROLE ... FROM user
GRANT ROLE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO role;  // all role management

// Privilege management
GRANT SHOW PRIVILEGE  ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT ASSIGN PRIVILEGE ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT REMOVE PRIVILEGE ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO role; // all privilege management

// Database management
GRANT CREATE DATABASE ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT DROP DATABASE   ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT ALTER DATABASE  ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT SET DATABASE ACCESS ON DBMS TO role;
GRANT DATABASE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO role; // all database management

// Procedure / function execution
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE apoc.* TO role;
GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE apoc.* TO role;  // elevated mode
GRANT EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION apoc.* TO role;
GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION apoc.* TO role;

// Full DBMS admin
GRANT ALL ON DBMS TO role;
```

---

## REVOKE Variants

```cypher
// Remove a GRANT
REVOKE GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person FROM analyst;

// Remove a DENY
REVOKE DENY READ {ssn} ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person FROM analyst;

// Remove both GRANT and DENY at once
REVOKE MATCH {*} ON GRAPH mydb NODES Person FROM analyst;
```

In Cypher 25, REVOKE on a non-existent privilege raises an **error** (was a notification in earlier versions).

---

## SHOW PRIVILEGE Commands

```cypher
SHOW PRIVILEGES YIELD *;
SHOW PRIVILEGES YIELD * WHERE access = 'DENIED';
SHOW PRIVILEGES YIELD * WHERE graph = 'mydb' ORDER BY role;

SHOW USER alice PRIVILEGES;
SHOW USER alice PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS;       // returns runnable GRANT statements

SHOW ROLE analyst PRIVILEGES;
SHOW ROLE analyst PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS;

SHOW ROLE analyst PRIVILEGES YIELD privilege, action, resource, graph, segment
WHERE action = 'read';

// AUTH RULES filter — privileges of roles granted to the named auth rules [2026.09]
SHOW AUTH RULES salesRule PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS;   // AUTH RULE / AUTH RULES both accepted; names comma-separated
```

`AS COMMANDS` output gains extra columns for filtering commands in `WHERE` [2026.09]; earlier releases return `command` and `immutable` only.

Recreate users and roles from a running DBMS [2026.09]:

```cypher
SHOW USERS AS COMMANDS;                    // CREATE USER statements
SHOW USERS WITH AUTH AS COMMANDS;          // + auth provider config and credentials
SHOW ROLES AS COMMANDS;                    // CREATE ROLE statements
SHOW ROLES WITH USERS AS COMMANDS;         // + GRANT ROLE ... TO user
SHOW ROLES WITH AUTH RULES AS COMMANDS;    // + GRANT ROLE ... TO AUTH RULE
```

`SHOW USERS WITH AUTH AS COMMANDS` exposes credentials. Use only for secured backup/restore handling. Prefer `SHOW USERS AS COMMANDS` when auth material is not required. Never paste auth-export output into shell history, docs, tickets, or source control.

## Access Decision Rules

1. `DENY` overrides `GRANT` — user with both gets the DENY.
2. Roles are additive — union of all assigned privileges, minus any DENY.
3. Missing `ACCESS ON DATABASE` = connection refused regardless of graph privileges.
4. Read restriction makes data **invisible** (not an error); write restriction returns an error.
5. `FOR` pattern restrictions apply at query time — every node match is filtered against the condition.
