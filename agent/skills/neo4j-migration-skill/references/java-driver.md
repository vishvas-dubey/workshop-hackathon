# Upgrade paths

Verify new driver version is compatible with the project's Java version before upgrading.

## Upgrading

Collect all changelogs between current and target version before upgrading.

Check the changelog between the major versions by following these links:
- [4.4 changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver/4.4-changelog.md)
- every other major version changelog URL follows this pattern: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver/{MAJOR_VERSION}.x-changelog.md` where `{MAJOR_VERSION}` should be replaced with the version you check the changelog for. E.g. for version 6.1 you'd fetch URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver/6.x-changelog.md . Do not replace the `.x` part of the URL
