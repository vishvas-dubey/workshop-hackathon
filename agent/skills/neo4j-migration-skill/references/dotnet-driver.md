Check the changelog between the major versions by following these links:
- [4.1 changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver/4.1-Changelog.md)
- [4.2 changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver/4.2-Change-Log.md)
- [4.3 changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver/4.3-Change-Log.md)

- every other major version changelog URL follows this pattern: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver/{MAJOR_VERSION}.X-Change-Log.md` where `{MAJOR_VERSION}` should be replaced with the major version you check the changelog for. E.g. for version 6.1 you'd fetch URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver/6.X-Change-Log.md . Do not replace the `.x` part of the URL
